### Sīl’uddesa-pāṭho Uposath’āvasāne Sajjhāyitabbo

Bhāsitam idaṃ tena Bhagavatā jānatā passatā  
arahatā sammā-sambuddhena,
Sampanna-sīlā bhikkhave viharatha  
sampanna-pāṭimokkhā,
Pāṭimokkha-saṃvara-saṃvutā viharatha  
ācāra-gocara-sampannā,
Aṇu-mattesu vajjesu bhaya-dassāvī  
samādāya sikkhatha sikkhāpadesū-ti.

Tasmā-tih’amhehi sikkhitabbaṃ,  
Sampanna-sīlā viharissāma sampannapāṭimokkhā,
Pāṭimokkha-saṃvara-saṃvutā viharissāma  
ācāra-gocara-sampannā,
Aṇu-mattesu vajjesu bhaya-dassāvī  
samādāya sikkhissāma sikkhāpadesū-ti,

Evañ hi no sikkhitabbaṃ.  

*The Noble, Worthy One,  
the One who knows and sees,  
He who is Awakened,  
this is what he said:  
Monks, you should be moral,  
keep the pātimokkha,  
Let the pātimokkha  
restrain you as it should.  
Do possess good conduct  
and keep good company,  
Seeing that there's danger   
in every slightest fault.  
Take the rules of training  
and train yourselves therin.*  

*Since this was said by him,  
we should practice thus:  
We will have good morals,  
keep the pātimokkha,  
Let the pātimokkha  
restrain us as it should.  
We will have good conduct  
and keep good company,  
Seeing that there's danger  
in every slightest fault.  
We undertake the rules  
and train ourselves therein.*  

*This the is the way  
that we should train ourselves.*

### Tāyana-gāthā

(*Handa mayaṁ tāyana-gāthāyo bhanāmase.*)

Chinda sotaṃ parakkamma  
Kāme panūda brāhmaṇa  
Nappahāya muni kāme  
N’ekattam-upapajjati  

Kayirā ce kayirāth’enaṃ  
Daḷham-enaṃ parakkame  
Sithilo hi paribbājo  
Bhiyyo ākirate rajaṃ  

Akataṃ dukkaṭaṃ seyyo  
Pacchā tappati dukkaṭaṃ  
Katañ-ca sukataṃ seyyo  
Yaṃ katvā nānutappati  

Kuso yathā duggahito  
Hattham-evānukantati  
Sāmaññaṃ dupparāmaṭṭhaṃ  
Nirayāyūpakaḍḍhati

Yaṅ-kiñci sithilaṃ kammaṃ  
Saṅkiliṭṭhañ-ca yaṃ vataṃ  
Saṅkassaraṃ brahma-cariyaṃ  
Na taṃ hoti mahapphalan-ti.  

*Srive, wise one, then cut off the stream,  
Give up craving for worldly things;  
If sense desire if not cut off,  
One-pointedness is out of reach.*

*With vigour he should strive indeed  
To do the deeds that should be done;  
Renunciants who are too slack  
Stir up the dirst and scatter dust.*  

*Do not do and evil act,  
For afterwards must come remorse.  
Good, by contrast, is to be done;  
It always leaves the conscience clear.*  

*Just like grass when wrongly held  
Will cut the hand without a doubt,  
The life of monks whn wrongly lived  
Will drag one down to dwell in hell.*  

*Actions that are slackly done,  
Any precepts that are defiled -   
A monk who lives a life suspect,  
Will never taste the noble fruit.*  

## English Pātimokkha

### Introduction 

Bhante, may I please recite the pātimokkha.

**Namo tassa Bhagavato Arahato Sammāsambuddhassa**

**Namo tassa Bhagavato Arahato Sammāsambuddhassa**

**Namo tassa Bhagavato Arahato Sammāsambuddhassa**

Bhante, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. Today is the uposatha, the fifteenth/fourteenth. If the Saṅgha is ready, we should perform the uposatha ceremony, we should recite the pātimokkha.

The venerables should declare their purity in advance.

I will recite the pātimokkha, and you should listen carefully. If you have committed an offence, you should say so. If not, you should remain silent. If you are silent, I will take it you are pure.

If you remember an offence but do not say so before the third announcement, you have lied in full awareness. Lying is called an obstruction by the Buddha. If you remember an offence and you seek purification, you should therefore disclose it. You will then be at ease.

The introduction is finished.

### Pārajika

Now the four pārājika rules come up for recitation.

**1.** If a bhikkhu has any kind of sexual intercourse, even with an animal, he incurs a pārājika.

**2.** If a bhikkhu commits theft punishable by imprisonment, he incurs a pārājika.

**3.** If a bhikkhu intentionally causes the death of a human being, he incurs a pārājika.

**4.** If a bhikkhu falsely claims an extraordinary spiritual attainment, except through overestimation, he incurs a pārājika.

The four pārājika rules have been recited. If a bhikkhu breaches any of them, he is no longer a bhikkhu.

I ask the venerables: are you pure in this?  
A second time I ask: are you pure in this?  
A third time I ask: are you pure in this?  
You are silent, and so I take it you are pure.

The pārājikas are finished.

### Sanghādisesa 

Now the thirteen saṅghādisesa rules come up for recitation.

**1.** If a bhikkhu intentionally ejaculates, except while dreaming, he incurs a saṅghādisesa.

**2.** If a bhikkhu, motivated by lust, touches a woman, he incurs a saṅghādisesa.

**3.** If a bhikkhu, motivated by lust, speaks sexually explicit words to a woman, he incurs a saṅghādisesa.

**4.** If a bhikkhu, motivated by lust, recommends to a woman that they have sexual intercourse, he incurs a saṅghādisesa.

**5.** If a bhikkhu acts as a go-between for a sexual relationship between a man and a woman, including marriage, he incurs a saṅghādisesa.

**6.** It may be that a bhikkhu, by means of begging, is building a kuṭi for himself without a sponsoring owner. If he does not get the Saṅgha to approve the site or if the kuṭi exceeds twelve by seven standard hand-spans, he incurs a saṅghādisesa.

**7.** It may be that a bhikkhu is building a large dwelling for himself with a sponsoring owner. If he does not get the Saṅgha to approve the site, he incurs a saṅghādisesa.

**8.** If a bhikkhu, motivated by anger, falsely accuses a bhikkhu of a pārājika, aiming to make him disrobe, he incurs a saṅghādisesa.

**9.** If a bhikkhu, motivated by anger, uses a ploy to falsely accuse a bhikkhu of a pārājika, aiming to make him disrobe, he incurs a saṅghādisesa.

**10.** If a bhikkhu is trying to cause a schism in the Saṅgha, he should be admonished up to three times to make him stop. If he does not stop, he incurs a saṅghādisesa.

**11.** If that bhikkhu has no more than three bhikkhu supporters, they should be admonished up to three times to make them stop. If they do not stop, they incur a saṅghādisesa.

**12.** If a bhikkhu refuses to be corrected about breaches of the pātimokkha rules, he should be admonished up to three times to make him stop. If he does not stop, he incurs a saṅghādisesa.

**13.** If a bhikkhu has corrupted the householders in a certain place, the Saṅgha should officially banish him from that place. If he criticises this act of banishment, he should be admonished up to three times to make him stop. If he does not stop, he incurs a saṅghādisesa.

The thirteen saṅghādisesa rules have been recited. If a bhikkhu breaches any of them, he must undergo pārivāsa for as many days as he has concealed the offence. He must then undergo mānatta for a further six days. A saṅgha of at least twenty bhikkhus should then rehabilitate him. If there are fewer than twenty bhikkhus in the saṅgha, that bhikkhu is not rehabilitated and those bhikkhus are at fault. This is the proper procedure.

I ask the venerables: are you pure in this?  
A second time I ask: are you pure in this?  
A third time I ask: are you pure in this?  
You are silent, and so I take it you are pure.

The saṅghādisesas are finished.

### Aniyata 

Now the two aniyata rules come up for recitation.

**1.** It may be that a bhikkhu sits alone in private with a woman in a secluded place and is seen by a trustworthy female lay disciple. If she accuses him of a pārājika, a saṅghādisesa, or a pācittiya, and if he admits that charge, he should be dealt with accordingly.

**2.** It may be that a bhikkhu sits alone in private with a woman and is seen by a trustworthy female lay disciple. If she accuses him of a saṅghādisesa or a pācittiya, and if he admits that charge, he should be dealt with accordingly.

I ask the venerables: are you pure in this?  
A second time I ask: are you pure in this?  
A third time I ask: are you pure in this?  
You are silent, and so I take it you are pure.
