## Tathāgata Arises -- MN 27

Idha tathāgato loke uppajjati arahaṁ sammāsambuddho vijjācaraṇasampanno sugato lokavidū anuttaro purisadammasārathi satthā devamanussānaṁ buddho bhagavā.

A Buddha appears in the world, accomplished, fully awakened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, well liberated, knower of worlds, incomparable teacher of those who can be taught, teacher of gods and humans, the awakened one, the master.  

So imaṁ lokaṁ sadevakaṁ samārakaṁ sabrahmakaṁ sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiṁ pajaṁ sadevamanussaṁ sayaṁ abhiññā sacchikatvā pavedeti.

He realizes with his own insight this world - with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans - and he makes it known to others.  

So dhammaṁ deseti ādikalyāṇaṁ majjhekalyāṇaṁ pariyosānakalyāṇaṁ sātthaṁ sabyañjanaṁ; kevalaparipuṇṇaṁ parisuddhaṁ brahmacariyaṁ pakāseti.

He teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and right phrasing, and he reveals a perfectly complete and pure spiritual life.  

## Dhammam sunāti -- MN 125

Taṁ dhammaṁ suṇāti gahapati vā gahapatiputto vā aññatarasmiṁ vā kule paccājāto.

A householder hears that teaching, or a householder's child, or someone reborn in a good family.  

So taṁ dhammaṁ sutvā tathāgate saddhaṁ paṭilabhati. So tena saddhāpaṭilābhena samannāgato iti paṭisañcikkhati:

They gain faith in the Realized One, and reflect:  

'sambādho gharāvāso rajopatho, abbhokāso pabbajjā. Nayidaṁ sukaraṁ agāraṁ ajjhāvasatā ekantaparipuṇṇaṁ ekantaparisuddhaṁ saṅkhalikhitaṁ brahmacariyaṁ carituṁ. Yannūnāhaṁ kesamassuṁ ohāretvā kāsāyāni vatthāni acchādetvā agārasmā anagāriyaṁ pabbajeyyan'ti.

'Household life is troublesome and busy; life as a monastic is free and relaxed. It is not easy, while living in a house, to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure. Suppose I shave off my hair, put on the orange robe, and go forth from the worldly life into monastic life.'  

So aparena samayena appaṁ vā bhogakkhandhaṁ pahāya mahantaṁ vā bhogakkhandhaṁ pahāya appaṁ vā ñātiparivaṭṭaṁ pahāya mahantaṁ vā ñātiparivaṭṭaṁ pahāya kesamassuṁ ohāretvā kāsāyāni vatthāni acchādetvā agārasmā anagāriyaṁ pabbajati.

On a later occasion, they give away all their wealth, abandoning their circle of relatives and friends, they shave off their hair, put on the orange robe, and go forth from the home life into monastic life.

Given this label and this claim, you should train like this: 'We will undertake and follow the things that make one an ascetic and a brahmin. That way our label will be accurate and our claim correct.  

Yesañca mayaṁ cīvarapiṇḍapātasenāsanagilānappaccayabhesajjaparikkhāraṁ paribhuñjāma, tesaṁ te kārā amhesu mahapphalā bhavissanti mahānisaṁsā, amhākañcevāyaṁ pabbajjā avañjhā bhavissati saphalā saudrayā'ti.Evañhi vo, bhikkhave, sikkhitabbaṁ.

Any robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick that we use will be very fruitful and beneficial for the donor. And our going forth will not be wasted, but will be fruitful and fertile.'  

Katame ca, bhikkhave, dhammā samaṇakaraṇā ca brāhmaṇakaraṇā ca?

They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.  

vivicceva kāmehi vivicca akusalehi dhammehi savitakkaṁ savicāraṁ vivekajaṁ pītisukhaṁ paṭhamaṁ jhānaṁ upasampajja viharati.

Then, totally free from the five senses, free from the hindrances, they enter upon and abide in the first jhāna, wherein the mind moves onto the object and holds on to it, the object being joy and pleasure caused by being totally free from the five senses.  

Puna caparaṁ, brāhmaṇa, bhikkhu vitakkavicārānaṁ vūpasamā ajjhattaṁ sampasādanaṁ cetaso ekodibhāvaṁ avitakkaṁ avicāraṁ samādhijaṁ pītisukhaṁ dutiyaṁ jhānaṁ upasampajja viharati.

When the mind stops moving onto the object and stops holding on to it, they enter upon and abide in the second jhāna, which has trust (in the object, the bliss, enough to let go of holding it) and unity of mind without any movement or holding, with joy and pleasure caused by perfect stillness.  

Puna caparaṁ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu pītiyā ca virāgā upekkhako ca viharati, sato ca sampajāno, sukhañca kāyena paṭisaṁvedeti, yaṁ taṁ ariyā ācikkhanti: 'upekkhako satimā sukhavihārī'ti tatiyaṁ jhānaṁ upasampajja viharati.

With the fading away of joy, they abide mindful and fully aware, experiencing a bliss purified from joy; they enter upon and abide in the third jhāna, on account of which noble ones announce: 'One has a pleasant abiding indeed who has such mindfulness and equanimity.'  

Puna caparaṁ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sukhassa ca pahānā dukkhassa ca pahānā, pubbeva somanassadomanassānaṁ atthaṅgamā, adukkhamasukhaṁ upekkhāsatipārisuddhiṁ catutthaṁ jhānaṁ upasampajja viharati.

Having abandoned pleasure and pain (all vedanā from the five senses), and with the disappearance of joy and grief (all vedanā from the sixth sense except for equanimity), they enter upon and abide in the fourth jhāna, which has only neutral mental vedanā remaining---just pure mindfulness with equanimity.  

## Tevijjā -- MN 39

### Pubbenivāsānussatiñānai

So evaṁ samāhite citte parisuddhe pariyodāte anangaṇe vigatūpakkilese mudubhūte kammaniye ṭhite āneñjappatte pubbenivāsānussatiñāṇāya cittaṁ abhininnāmeti.

When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished, rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives.  

So anekavihitaṁ pubbenivāsaṁ anussarati, seyyathidaṁ -- ekampi jātiṁ dvepi jātiyo tissopi jātiyo catassopi jātiyo pañcapi jātiyo dasapi jātiyo vīsampi jātiyo tiṁsampi jātiyo cattālīsampi jātiyo paññāsampi jātiyo jātisatampi jātisahassampi jātisatasahassampi anekepi saṁvaṭṭakappe anekepi vivaṭṭakappe anekepi saṁvaṭṭavivaṭṭakappe -

'amutrāsiṁ evaṁnāmo evaṁgotto evaṁvaṇṇo evamāhāro evaṁsukhadukkhappaṭisaṁvedī evamāyupariyanto, so tato cuto amutra udapādiṁ; tatrāpāsiṁ evaṁnāmo evaṁgotto evaṁvaṇṇo evamāhāro evaṁsukhadukkhappaṭisaṁvedī evamāyupariyanto, so tato cuto idhūpapanno'ti.

'There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my nutriment, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term; and passing away from there, I reappeared elsewhere; and there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my nutriment, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term; and passing away from there, I reappeared here.'

So dibbena cakkhunā visuddhena atikkantamānusakena satte passāmi cavamāne upapajjamāne hīne paṇīte suvaṇṇe dubbaṇṇe sugate duggate yathākammūpage satte pajānāmi -

With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate. He understands how beings pass on according to their actions thus -  

'ime vata bhonto sattā kāyaduccaritena samannāgatā vacīduccaritena samannāgatā manoduccaritena samannāgatā ariyānaṁ upavādakā micchādiṭṭhikā micchādiṭṭhikammasamādānā; te kāyassa bhedā paraṁ maraṇā apāyaṁ duggatiṁ vinipātaṁ nirayaṁ upapannā.

'These worthy beings who were ill conducted in body, speech, and mind, revilers of noble ones, wrong in their views, giving effect to wrong view in their actions, on the dissolution of the body, after death, have reappeared in a state of deprivation, in a bad destination, in perdition, even in hell; but these worthy beings who were well conducted in body, speech, and mind, not revilers of noble ones, right in their views, giving effect to right view in their actions, on the dissolution of the body, after death, have reappeared in a good destination, even in the heavenly world.'  

Iti dibbena cakkhunā visuddhena atikkantamānusakena satte passāmi cavamāne upapajjamāne hīne paṇīte suvaṇṇe dubbaṇṇe sugate duggate yathākammūpage satte pajānāmi.

When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished, rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the destruction of the taints.  

So 'idaṁ dukkhan'ti yathābhūtaṁ pajānāti, 'ayaṁ dukkhasamudayo'ti yathābhūtaṁ pajānāti, 'ayaṁ dukkhanirodho'ti yathābhūtaṁ pajānāti, 'ayaṁ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā'ti yathābhūtaṁ pajānāti. 'Ime āsavā'ti yathābhūtaṁ pajānāti, 'ayaṁ āsavasamudayo'ti yathābhūtaṁ pajānāti, 'ayaṁ āsavanirodho'ti yathābhūtaṁ pajānāti, 'ayaṁ āsavanirodhagāminī paṭipadā'ti yathābhūtaṁ pajānāti.

He understands as it actually is: 'This is suffering';...'This is the origin of suffering';...'This is the cessation of suffering';...'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering';... 'These are the taints';...'This is the origin of the taints';...'This is the cessation of the taints';...'This is the way leading to the cessation of the taints.'  

Tassa evaṁ jānato evaṁ passato kāmāsavāpi cittaṁ vimuccati, bhavāsavāpi cittaṁ vimuccati, avijjāsavāpi cittaṁ vimuccati.

Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.  

Vimuttasmiṁ vimuttamiti ñāṇaṁ hoti:

When they're freed, they know they're freed.  

'khīṇā jāti, vusitaṁ brahmacariyaṁ, kataṁ karaṇīyaṁ, nāparaṁ itthattāyā'ti pajānāti. They understand:

'Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.'
